You can use either:
Pre-installed Gradle: gradle Linux: ./gradlew Windows: gradlew.bat Building requires JDK 11 or above. The server can be compiled and packaged with a single command:

server: The host name (default: localhost). port: The port to bind to for listening (default: 7000). launchProverCommand: The location of the script to run the reasoner. The contents of the docker.properties file, which is used in the Docker image, is shown as an example below:
