The reasoner can automatically generate executable [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) code for process compositions, including code templates for the involved resource types and atomic processes.

The code relies on the use of the [WorkflowFM PEW execution engine](https://github.com/workflowfm/pew).

-   This can be accomplished  by **right-clicking** on a composite process and selecting the {{< icon "client/icons/Deploy.png" "deploy icon" "inline" >}} `Deploy in Scala` option.

This will open a new window with the appropriate dialog for deploying code. Using the [Ski example]({{< relref "examples" >}}), the window is shown below:
